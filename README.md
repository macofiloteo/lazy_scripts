# lazy_scripts

Its been how many years since I started this project? 3? 4? I don't even remember.
These are my script ideas that I would like to implement because I'm too lazy to do them manually.
- [x] Toggling audio sink/out between headphones and speakers.
- [ ] Simple HTTP server to serve files to my network. Kinda like a mini NAS or media server.
